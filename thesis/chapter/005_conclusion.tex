\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}

The study set out to determine how feasible and precise data mining attacks on simple git metadata.
All three performed attacks, lead to promising results and showed potential for actual usage in a professional environment.
However, it must be noted that in all attacks only a small amount of the available data was used.
The possible applications for the remaining data, such as actual changes in code, cross references of contributors between repositories or commit messages, are extensive.


In the introduction of this thesis, many possible attack vectors have been displayed.
