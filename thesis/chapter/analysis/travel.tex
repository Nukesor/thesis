\section{Geo location}

This attack aims to extract information about the actual location on the globe of a target.
The algorithm tries to firstly determine the exact timezone of the target and then to exclude any countries or states, which do not match the observed timestamps.
There are several possible vectors for this attack:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Detect the main country or timezone of a target.
    \item Analyse where and how often a target travels to a specific location.
    \item Determine the location of a workforce of a company.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Implementation}\label{travel-implementation}

The data used for this analysis are all commit timestamps of the target, as well as the target's Github location for verification.
In the following I will explain the algorithm used to detect the different timezones and determine the main location of the contributor.

\begin{minted}{python}
def preprocess(commits):
    punchcard = [0] * 168
    for commit in commits:
        hour = commit.commit_time.hour # returns 0-23
        weekday = = commit.commit_time.weekday() # returns 0-6

        index = weekday*24 + hour
        punchcard[index] += 1

\end{minted}
